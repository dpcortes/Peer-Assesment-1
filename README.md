# Peer-Assesment-1

this has been a hard work. Not the r program or the knitr conversion but the submission.
For reasons I do not quite understand the md file was generated with the figures ommited. The instruction was like: 
"![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3](figure/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)" 
So that is not to plot.
When I submmited the files to Github, of course the graphs did not show and I had to edit the file. Firt eliminating the !s. Even 
then, the link attached to each figure was strange: there was a blob/master directory so I had to change the default directory by the one actually contains the figures
